## üèÜ Projects

### 1. KRX Financial LLM Competition (Team Leader)
**Oct ‚Äì Dec 2024** | **Role:** Team Leader

**Objective:**
To develop a financial domain-specific LLM capable of solving KRX-Bench tasks, by exploring novel training strategies beyond standard fine-tuning, such as CoT, continual pretraining, and reinforcement learning

**Overview & Innovations:**
- Explored advanced training methods beyond vanilla fine-tuning:
  - **Continual Pretraining** on proprietary finance corpora
  - **DPO** and **ORPO**
  - **CoT Prompting** and **Knowledge Distillation** to enhance reasoning
- Generated high-quality MCQA datasets with CoT rationales using Claude and GPT-4o
- Adopted domain adaptation strategies inspired by:
  - *Adapting LLMs to Domains via Reading Comprehension*
  - *Improving Domain Adaptation through Extended-Text Reading Comprehension*

**Key Contributions:**
- Architected a distributed training pipeline using FSDP for large-scale model parallelism
- Curated and synthesized specialized financial MCQA data with rationale chains
- Implemented CoT prompting templates, DPO/ORPO fine-tuning routines, and distillation workflows
- Built an internal leaderboard (PostgreSQL + Plotly-Dash) for rigorous model evaluation and comparison

**Results:**
- Achieved **+13 points** improvement in financial accounting accuracy over baseline
- Secured **2nd place (prelims)** and **12th place (nationals)** among 100+ competing teams

### 2. Information Retrieval (RAG) Chatbot (Project Lead)
**Jun ‚Äì Jul 2024** | **Role:** Project Lead

**Objective:**
Design and deploy a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that answers domain queries with high relevance by fusing vector embeddings and BM25 scores.

**Overview:**
Built a modular retrieval system combining custom-trained embeddings for internal documents and open-source BM25 indexing. Integrated the retriever with a chat interface, enabling real-time Q&A enriched by retrieved context.

**Key Contributions:**
- **Embedding Model:** Fine-tuned a bilingual sentence-transformer on proprietary knowledge graphs to yield 768‚Äëdim vectors.  
- **Fusion Strategy:** Developed a hybrid scoring mechanism that normalizes and merges cosine similarity with BM25 ranking to select top‚Äëk passages.  
- **System Integration:** Deployed on FastAPI with Redis caching, achieving sub‚Äë200ms retrieval latency.  
- **UX Design:** Frontend prototype in React; incorporated an interactive UI showing source citations alongside answers.

**Results:**
- **+20%** improvement in answer relevance compared to a pure BM25 baseline.  
- Handled **5,000+** queries per day with **99.5% uptime** post‚Äëdeployment.

### 3. Dialogue Summarisation Competition (AI Engineer)
**Aug ‚Äì Sep 2024** | **Role:** AI Engineer

**Objective:**
Enhance Korean‚ÄìEnglish dialogue summarisation by combining advanced preprocessing, keyword extraction, and model fine-tuning to excel in a national NLP contest.

**Overview:**
Performed exhaustive data cleaning on noisy dialogue transcripts, integrated morphological analysis for keyword guidance, and fine-tuned a 10B‚Äëparameter EEVE model with LoRA and 4‚Äëbit quantization to maximize performance under resource constraints.

**Key Contributions:**
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaned 50k+ dialogue pairs, fixed special-token errors, and removed semantic outliers via cosine-similarity filters.  
- **Keyword Pipeline:** Extracted salient terms using Komoran/Nori analyzers; injected keywords into prompts to steer summarisation.  
- **Name Standardisation:** Applied NER + Korean phoneme heuristics to align entity mentions across languages.  
- **Model Optimization:** Leveraged LoRA adapters and 4‚Äëbit nf4 quantization to enable efficient fine‚Äëtuning on a single 24‚ÄØGB GPU.

**Results:**
- Ranked **Top 3** with a **ROUGE‚ÄëL score of 44.16**.  
- Demonstrated that extensive preprocessing + lightweight fine-tuning outperforms naive full‚Äëparameter updates.

### 4. Template Extension Chrome Add‚ÄëOn (Developer)
**Apr 2022** | **Role:** Developer

**Objective:**
Create a cross-platform Chrome extension to streamline repetitive communication by managing text/image templates directly in the browser.

**Overview:**
Developed a user-friendly UI for template creation, preview, and insertion. Designed backend APIs for real-time template storage and updates, and ensured compatibility across Gmail, LinkedIn, and messaging apps.

**Key Contributions:**
- **Frontend:** Built with React and Tailwind CSS; implemented drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop template editor.  
- **Backend API:** FastAPI + MongoDB for secure template CRUD operations.  
- **Extension Logic:** Injected content scripts to detect active text fields and offer insertion shortcuts.  
- **User Feedback Loop:** Collected usage metrics and heatmaps to refine UI/UX.

**Results:**
- Published on Chrome Web Store; received positive feedback from recruiters and sales teams.  
- Increased outreach efficiency by **30%** in internal user surveys.
